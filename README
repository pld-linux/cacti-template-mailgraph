Multiple graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To collect multiple graphs from different hosts, use syslog to route the mail
logs to your cacti host.

Use --host=HOST and --logfile and --daemon-rrd=DIR options to combine results
for your needs.

You could even merge results from mailhost1 and mailhost2 if you write their
logs to single file with syslog and do not specify --host argument to
mailgraph.pl daemon.
