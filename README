Setup
~~~~~

To install this template:

1. Start mailgraph, be sure that .rrd files are created in /var/lib/mailgraph,
verify permissions if they do not get created.

2. adjust permissions that webserver is able to read the mailgraph .rrd files.

3. Create graph via "New Graphs":
select "Postfix Processing (Mailgraph)" for host and hit "Create"

3. Change data templates point to .rrd files:
for "Postfix Processing (Mailgraph)" choose /var/lib/mailgraph/mailgraph.rrd
for "Postfix Processing Virus (Mailgraph)" choose /var/lib/mailgraph/mailgraph_virus.rrd

Enjoy!

Multiple graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To collect multiple graphs from different hosts, use syslog to route the mail
logs to your cacti host.

Use --host=HOST and --logfile and --daemon-rrd=DIR options to combine results
for your needs.

You could even merge results from mailhost1 and mailhost2 if you write their
logs to single file with syslog and do not specify --host argument to
mailgraph.pl daemon.

for example via syslog-ng:
1. server side (accepting logs):
  source s_net { udp(); };
  filter f_mail { facility(mail); };
  destination mail_net {
    file(
       "/var/log/mail/$HOST" owner(root) group(http) perm(0640)
       create_dirs(yes) dir_perm(0710) dir_owner(root) dir_group(http)
    );
  };
  log { source(s_net); filter(f_mail); destination(mail_net); };

2. client side (sending logs):
destination maillog { udp("cactihost" port(514)); };
log { source(s_sys); filter(f_mail); destination(maillog); };
